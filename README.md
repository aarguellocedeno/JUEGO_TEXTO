In this project, we use OpenAL to add music and sound effects that enhance immersion. The game is developed in Python as a text-based adventure and uses object-oriented programming (OOP) to model the main components: Girl, Madam, Game, and Orphanage.

#### What’s it about?

The story follows a girl who, due to life’s circumstances, loses her parents and is taken to an orphanage. There she encounters the enigmatic Madam, who turns out to be the very same person responsible for her parents’ disappearance.
